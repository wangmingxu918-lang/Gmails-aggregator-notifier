## How to log in to initiate the program

The program need an **APP PASSWORD** instead of your email password, you can find them where:
 
- Step 1: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Go to Google Account Security.
Under "Signing in to Google", make sure 2-Step Verification is ON.
If it’s not, click “2-Step Verification” and follow the instructions to enable it.
This step is required to generate an App Password (your normal password won’t work).
- Step 2: Enable IMAP Access in Gmail
Log in to your Gmail account in a web browser.
Click the gear icon → See all settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP.
Under IMAP Access, select “Enable IMAP”.
Save changes at the bottom.
- Step 3: Generate a Gmail App Password
Go to Google App Passwords.
You may be asked to log in again.
Under “Select app”, choose Other (Custom name) and type something like JavaEmailClient.
Click Generate.
A 16-character password will appear. This is the App Password you use in your program instead of your normal Gmail password.
Example: abcd efgh ijkl mnop → type it as abcdefghijklmnop (no spaces).
Important: Store this App Password somewhere safe. You can revoke it anytime.
